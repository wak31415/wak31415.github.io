So far, very little research has been done on the applications of machine learning to
the topological field of knot theory. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to investigate directly leveraging the topological structure of knots for learning
tasks to predict certain properties.
We show that graph neural networks, in particular graph isomorphism networks,
provide better accuracy in predicting the symmetry of prime knots, indicating that
the structure of knots can indeed be leveraged. While the performance of models is
still not sufficient for useful applications in research in mathematics, we hope that
this study inspires further research at the intersection of knot theory and geometric
learning methods.
