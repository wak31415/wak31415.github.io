I am currently a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at Princeton University, advised by Prof. Felix Heide, after having worked in strategy consulting (Boston Consulting Group).

My interests include, or have included
* Intersection between classical computer graphics and machine learning (Gaussian Splatting, NeRFs), especially on unsupervised structural awareness
* Geometric approaches to deep learning, in particular graph-based methods
* Privacy and related research in cryptography, e.g., secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption, as well as ethical and legal considerations
