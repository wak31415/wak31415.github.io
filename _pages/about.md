I am currently working as an Associate for BCG (Boston Consulting Group) in Munich. I previously completed my master in Computer Science at the University of Oxford (advised by Phil Torr, Victor Prisacariu and Ismail Ceylan), and graduated from Ã‰cole Polytechnique in Mathematics & Computer Science with Summa Cum Laude.

My interests include, or have included
* Privacy and related research in cryptography, e.g., secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption, as well as ethical and legal considerations
* Intersection between classical computer graphics and machine learning, especially the reconstruction of dynamic environments
* Geometric approaches to deep learning, in particular graph-based methods
