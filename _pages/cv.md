Education
======
* M.Sc in Advanced Computer Science, University of Oxford (2022 - 2023)
* B.Sc in Mathematics & Computer Science, Ecole Polytechnique (2018 - 2021)
* International Honors Program, Stanford University (2019)

Work and research experience
======
**Associate, Boston Consulting Group GmbH (from 2023)**

**ML research intern, Active Vision Lab, University of Oxford (2023)**
* Conducted research on using non-rigid neural radiance fields for virtual reality video conferencing with the Engineering department at the University of Oxford; supervised by Ismail Ceylan, Victor Prisacariu and Philip Torr
* Developed an efficient novel-pose and view synthesis model that can be used in downstream tasks such as virtual reality video conferencing systems. The system uses input from a standard webcam, and then generates different perspectives of the person in front of the camera
* To achieve the required real-time performance, proposed a simple preprocessing stage during training and inference which relies on existing priors to optimize ray sampling

**Applied science intern, Zalando Switzerland AG (2022)**
* Designed and implemented generative adversarial neural networks
* Initiated and conducted experiments on unsupervised image inpainting
* Contributed to the architectural design of 3D generative models to be trained without 3D data by leveraging suggestive contours
* Made significant performance improvements to existing image tooling
* Added additional tools to a common library for simple general-purpose preprocessing (such as semantic segmentation and dense UV unwrapping of humans)
* Developed a new application for automatically generating datasets of model images with desired attributes.

**Consulting intern, d-fine GmbH (2021)**
* Six-month full-time internship with two projects, one on sustainable and climate friendly urban transport and another focusing on decentralized cloud using distributed ledger technologies.

**Cryptography research intern, Telecom Paris (2020)**
* Thesis on privacy-preserving face recognition in large-scale video surveillance systems using Secure Multi- Party Computation. Proposed a new framework for face recognition that makes mass-surveillance cryptographically impossible (however, with performance limitations).

**Cryptography research intern, Deutsche Bank AG (2020)**
* Two-month full-time internship, responsible for researching on machine learning on encrypted data using homomorphic encryption and implementing a Proof of Concept.
